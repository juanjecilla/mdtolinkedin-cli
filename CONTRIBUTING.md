# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to `mdtolinkedin`.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (`rustup default stable`)
- Git

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanjecilla/mdtolinkedin-cli.git
cd mdtolinkedin-cli
cargo build
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch with the `feature/` prefix.
2. Keep changes focused and add tests when behavior changes.
3. Run the standard checks before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

If you have `make` available, the same checks are available via:

```bash
make ci
```

## Tests

- Unit tests live next to code under `src/`.
- Integration tests live in `tests/`.
- Fixture updates are generated by `scripts/update_fixtures.py`.

## Release Process

See `RELEASE.md` for the full release checklist, packaging steps, and distribution updates.

## Documentation

- `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md` for the full CLI reference.
- `docs/CODE_BLOCKS.md` for code-block handling details.

## Code Style

- Prefer small, focused functions.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths.
- Add comments only when behavior isn’t obvious from the code.
